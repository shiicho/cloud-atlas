# 02-with-groups
# ===============
# Introduction to functional grouping.
# Hosts are organized by their role (webservers, dbservers).
#
# Benefits:
#   - Target specific groups: ansible -i 02-with-groups webservers -m ping
#   - Apply role-specific configurations
#   - Easier to understand infrastructure layout
#
# Usage:
#   ansible -i 02-with-groups webservers --list-hosts
#   ansible -i 02-with-groups dbservers --list-hosts
